Considering that, software-defined networks require accurate and timely data-plane state information. Network monitoring mechanisms usually require considerable resources on SDN controllers as well as on the data-plane elements. In this paper, we propose an optimization of the statistic transmission to reduce costs on both control- and data-plane regardless of the used monitoring application and statistic provisioning tool. To this end, we intercept the statistic message exchange and 1) aggregate multiple requests coming from different monitoring applications/controllers, 2) filter irrelevant statistic messages with respect to their information gain before delivering them to the control applications, and 3) deploy statistic caching. The proposed system, denoted STATISTIC REQUEST RELAY, forms a logically centralized statistic relay between controllers and the managed data-plane network. Our evaluation shows that the number of statistics processed on controllers as well as statistic requests on switches is reduced significantly while the performance penalty is negligible when using statistic aggregation and filtering as proposed here.', 'inCitations': ['8bc41ecb5263f7a1fae6087e6929005325361486'], 'pdfUrls': ['https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2018.2876654'], 'title': 'Reducing the Monitoring Footprint on Controllers in Software-Defined Networks', 'doi': '10.1109/TNSM.2018.2876654', 'sources': ['DBLP'], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2018.2876654', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management'}\n",

Why there are two distinct receptors for the same ligand and whether these receptors mediate their signal independently or synergistically is not known. We examined the role of these two receptors in the ligand-dependent activation of a transcriptional factor, NF-kappaB, an early response (5-15 min) to TNF in human myeloid ML-1a cells. By using receptor type-specific antibodies, these cells were found to express almost equal amounts of both receptors. TNF-dependent activation of NF-kappaB could be blocked partially by both anti-p60 and anti-p80, suggesting that TNF mediates its effect independently through the p60 and p80 receptors. In comparison, the activation of NF-kappaB by lymphotoxin (LT), which shares receptors with TNF, was completely blocked by anti-p60, whereas anti-p80 had no effect. Anti-p60 but not anti-p80 by itself was found to activate NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner, but on a molar basis anti-p60 was found to be 100 times less potent than TNF. Interestingly, even though anti-p80 by itself was inactive, it potentiated the effect of anti-p60 synergistically, suggesting an interaction between the two types of TNF receptor. Thus, overall these results demonstrate that the two forms of TNF receptors could mediate their signal in both an independent and synergistic manner and that TNF mediates its signal through both forms of receptors, whereas LT mediates its signal through the p60 receptor.', 'inCitations': ['dcd747b0c6259e35bfc2f67793e440a111227bbd', 'beadeee1309c351dc10af68a3c4db25e1dece743'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'Evidence for a synergistic role of two types of human tumor necrosis factor receptors for the ligand-dependent activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB.', 'doi': '10.1089/jir.1998.18.117', 'sources': ['Medline'], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.1998.18.117', 'venue': 'Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research'}\n",

In this paper, a direct method for the estimation of these points using explicit equations is introduced. The method employs a piecewise linear approximation of the current vs. voltage curve of each photovoltaic panel in the string and assumes that the open circuit voltage and the position of the maximum power points of each panel are known. Numerical results comparing the performances of the proposed approach with those offered by the adoption of the accurate single diode model show that the computational burden is reduced by almost four orders of magnitude. The approach is validated by experimental results exhibiting estimation errors lower than 5%. The satisfactory trade-off between accuracy and computation time provided by the proposed method is illustrated using two application examples: reconfiguration and long-term power production of PV strings. Moreover, an in-depth comparison of the existing simplified methods to estimate the MPPs has been performed.', 'inCitations': ['a2680c76b8ad6e0cd1f91687ce115789a7f1a8df', '63ed42ad978f95dee83e67a33b27c9ce148664c8', '89779f331e4389fc3a8dd42040ea4ba947fdec9d', '350f762cf4ea5f2321c4f60f695416e3df08194e', 'fa6bba99651fd7c7d29268d6b3591462c3d008ca'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'A method for the fast estimation of the maximum power points in mismatched PV strings', 'doi': '10.1016/j.epsr.2014.11.028', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2014.11.028', 'venue': ''}\n",

Knowledge of sexuality and AIDS was greater among study participants than among controls. Attitudes toward erotophobia condoms contraception and people with AIDS were also different among participants. Intentions to adopt prevention-oriented behaviors were also greater among study participants. A follow-up of 250 students was conducted in order to assess actual behavior change; analysis is pending. The curriculum is easy to implement and low-cost. The intervention and evaluation were developed by researchers and planners at the Cayetano Heredia University in Lima. The curriculum emphasized empowerment self-esteem information attitude change skill development and a supportive environment. The 14-hour program covered the following topics: 1) puberty and adolescence 2) sexual anatomy and physiology and human sexual responses 3) conception and pregnancy (delivery breast feeding and unwanted pregnancy) 4) planned parenthood and contraceptive technologies including abortion 5) sex and gender (social and cultural aspects and sexual orientation) 6) AIDS/STDs and condom skills and 7) personal decision making about sexual issues (assertive communication skills and self-determination).

Such information, although provided at a real time basis, may not satisfy the real need of personal travel as the information is provided without much consideration on individual's preferences. The provision of personalized travel information through the development of a three-tier client server based traveler information system on Internet (TISONI) is discussed in the paper. In this system, personalized travel advices are provided through a combinatorial modeling approach, which combines models describing travel behavior and shortest path algorithm. TISONI is developed to provide personalized and multimodal transit travel information to users. The three-tier structure adopted in TISONI facilitates a convenient and efficient way to update and transmit data between client and server. The core of TISONI is a path choice model, which was developed by calibrating users' behavior in mode and route choices. The personalized information covers two main aspects: (1) recognition of the users and their preferences and (2) personalized information provided to users by learning. Based on the architecture presented, real time data transmission and process, user interfaces and connectivity were introduced integrating with path choice models. Java servlets, JSP, as new technologies, run on a TISONI server, features high performance, database connectivity, stability, and security and perform most dynamic content operations. An implementation and evaluation of TISONI prototype based on western part of Singapore was discussed. Such implementation aims to test and demonstrate the capability of dynamic modification, path search and decision models, computation speed, and users interface. The three main criteria including timeliness, intelligence and efficiency were used to evaluate the good performance of this prototype model. It is concluded that the proposed architecture is able to provide a stable and efficient platform for provision of personalized travel information to transit users.\", 'inCitations': ['e00c7b48225b6a5ef5fa4fb4b495e3b6cb4aac23'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'Provision of Personalised Transit Travel Information - System and Architecture', 'doi': '', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': '', 'venue': ''}\n",

In those regions, elevated nitrate concentrations put additional pressure on the scarce water resources, as they pose a serious health risk. This study applies a multidisciplinary approach (hydrogeology, isotope hydrology, and geochemistry) to understand the origin and fate of nitrate in groundwater of the semi-arid Kalahari of Botswana. Our investigations suggest that nitrate in groundwater of the study area is of natural origin, leached from a pool in the unsaturated zone that was actively involved in the soil nitrogen cycle. The presence of active (minor) recharge was found, showing that nitrate may be transported into the groundwater under the present conditions. Yet, slow travel times of replenishing water and the low recharge amounts render the thick unsaturated zone into a long-term reservoir for nitrate. Being only little influenced by reactive processes, nitrate has a high persistency in the observed groundwater system. Concentration increases induced by the present land-use do not yet appear to affect the groundwater quality but may within decades.', 'inCitations': ['49583bde34cda13f4fb4f083ad512f0a65b39ff0', '68a137b9016889c94877da6f3c4eb4300719b9da', 'bd1e3812bceda36ee6abcb57226778c83ff6e336', '208a546f44e0d39199081f19d7fcdb7cf8c04688', '142d119b8ef872d347fb832938a7dc22ce25b8bd', '9736ad72f0b6fdf56f0b2fc1f579a5e1cecfd1a4', 'ddb25a2c6256ffacd827007afb2977929847f0e7', 'ddb7b13d848fd35d45b6c213b1ccac80aea90f21', '4b32500080ce7a30fd102b93541dde89d118c6c9', 'c926a46b15166a2921fd4cc530f924eba339569a', '3d30fd4627e6560c689e45afb69db6636183f6a2', 'f3e9573613535067c305fd360f27752fca7277d0', 'cb7177a7895808fc52321a0159def2d286f17493', 'e6c7a7dfad028b7f148bd9d4690f75d24ab3f344', '33476bc90e5e2bd453caa55a190bb3d46898ada8', 'b37e5c01e98a73543f8c9c00f77770d809167521', '2f5feeb907e6b7adac18d84628d1d2ac07f11558', '887d812ade036a10162ce4e620c1d5fe94876531', 'b71f039845a4565298d6911931499a1e7c8bdb36', '2f98d71771a6f8e563cfea2b38d22805988dc12b', 'dc28c9204e744a6070ada811cfc8ab92559d19cf', 'b41fabc73fb533624fd0057606efd822f7736de0', 'a10786f380ef6f10080a8e826311942a535f4db9', '7807cc550233b41b9e0a8b6862c173e624d07b6d', '8d173624742e930a57a5d42f10b4cefb75b1216d', 'be83edd8b601708e7e3c57804018a2ba6a9563ba'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'Understanding the origin and fate of nitrate in groundwater of semi-arid environments', 'doi': '10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.06.003', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.06.003', 'venue': ''}\n",

Sex differences are reported in a variety of neural regions, with many being homologous to sexually-differentiated and steroid-sensitive regions in experimental animals. Males tend to have larger brains and more white matter or cerebrospinal fluid, whereas females have proportionally more grey matter and, possibly, enhanced neuropil. High-resolution techniques suggest reliable sex differences for certain hypothalamic-related nuclei. Cortical volumes or the volumes adjusted for differences in brain size are reported to be greater for females in certain frontal and medial paralimbic areas and the superior temporal gyrus. In particular, females have increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas males have greater age-related tissue loss there and potentially in other brain areas. Conversely, greater male volumes have been reported in frontomedial cortex and the inferior parietal lobule, although conflicting results have been reported for the parietal lobule. Evidence is accumulating that sex steroid hormones influence some of the gender differences in human behavior. Evidence from experimental animals suggests that sex steroid effects may depend upon the specific hormone of exposure, for example, natural estrogens vs. synthetic estrogens vs. testosterone vs. testosterone metabolites and the period of life, prenatal or early postnatal vs. adulthood.', 'inCitations': [], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': '9 – Do Sex Steroid Hormones Contribute to Sexual Differentiation of the Human Brain?', 'doi': '10.1016/B978-012440905-7/50274-7', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012440905-7%2F50274-7', 'venue': ''}\n",

Pharmacokinetic assays were performed in all animals after 2 months of the experiment. Phenytoin was given intragastrically as a single dose 10 mg/kg. Blood for assays was sampled within 48 hours after phenytoin administration. The two compartment open model for extravascular administration was used for calculations. It was demonstrated that the administration of phenytoin in the group of animals with experimental hyperlipidemia was followed by a decrease of the drug concentration in the blood serum, a drop in area under the plasma concentration-time curve, a shorter elimination half-time as well as an increase in total body clearance.

Let us first look briefly at the classical pathway, in which phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns) is phosphorylated by PtdIns 4-kinase to PtdIns-4-P, which is subsequently phosphorylated by PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase to form PtdIns-4,5-P2. Much of the PtdIns-4,5-P2 in the cell is found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This lipid can serve as a substrate for PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC), liberating DAG and IP3. IP3 is a water-soluble molecule which, when released into the cytosol, acts to liberate intracellular stores of Ca2+, increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ from the resting level of ~110 nM to 400–1000 nM, which in turn can activate a number of Ca2+-sensitive enzymes and channels. The DAG released from Ptdlns-4,5-P2 remains in the membrane and serves as a cofactor in activating many of the protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes.', 'inCitations': ['73d9a985581a0e9134d27ddc25fd97e4f1071339', 'ac320c75c656d7b15672379f544fb5689d5abffd', '744f7452d902ee449a3b81cc89585af17688760c', 'a0e8d7c956c912accc9b5598712cef536de4bca5'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'PI 3-Kinase and Receptor-Linked Signal Transduction', 'doi': '10.1007/978-1-4899-1361-6_4', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-1361-6_4', 'venue': ''}\n",

We deal with the question of how often control information needs to be sent to the rate scheduler so as to stay below a certain probability of congestion. We first consider some simple Markovian service rate allocation policies and derive the corresponding control rate vs. congestion probability tradeoffs in closed form. However, since a closed form solution is not possible for more general Markov policies, we resort to large deviation tools to characterize the congestion probabilities of various control policies. We also identify a simple dasiatwo-thresholdpsila policy which achieves the best possible tradeoff between rate of control and the decay exponent of the congestion probability.

Small molecule inhibitors of HSP90 (H90Ins) or oncogenic kinases (KI) have shown limited efficacy as monotherapy in clinical trials. This is due to the development of drug resistance resulting in oncogenic reprogramming. Studies in other tumor models have demonstrated that this can be mitigated through combined H90Ins and KI therapy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the rationale for combined H90Ins and KI therapy in MIBC. METHODS: Using the HSP90 interactome network database, we identified all the HSP90 interacting genes and profiled these genes in the TCGA for MIBC. We determined the number of interactors that were either overexpressed or mutated in MIBC. These results were subjected to gene ontology analysis. Next, we focused on the HSP90 interacting kinases overexpressed in MIBC and identified an up to date set of clinically actionable targets. RESULTS: Over 130 HSP90 interacting genes were mutated or overexpressed in 10% of the 408 MIBC patients in TCGA. The top 4 mutated genes included TTN at 18%, TP53 at 16%, EP300 at 5% and SPTAN1 at 4% of all patients. The top 100 overexpressed genes observed in 11 to 28% of cases included TTI1, YWHAZ, RAF1 and SETBD1. Comparing the number of patients with mutations to gene overexpression suggests that mRNA expression levels may be the more significant driver of disease. From gene ontology analysis, the biology of MIBC appears to involve alterations in macromolecule metabolism and the regulation of nitrogen compounds. Interestingly, when the oncogenic kinases were specifically profiled, all patients overexpressed at least one HSP90 dependent kinase. In over 40% of the cases, more than one HSP90 dependent kinase was overexpressed. Of the HSP90 dependent kinases combined, RAF1, AKT2, EGFR, YES1, GSK3A PRKAA1 and PTK2 were seen in 68% of the cases and represent targets for which drugs are currently available. CONCLUSIONS: While the altered HSP90 gene network have a modest impact on the biology of MIBC, the more profound influence is exerted through the control of the oncogenic kinases involved in the disease. This data strongly supports the use of combination HSP90 and kinase inhibitor therapy in a patient specific and precision medicine model.', 'inCitations': [], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'Mp01-01 Combined Heat Shock Protein 90 and Kinase Inhibitor Therapy: Insights from the Cancer Genome Atlas for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer', 'doi': '10.1016/j.juro.2016.02.1831', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2016.02.1831', 'venue': ''}\n",

The Central Africa savannah zone counts about 260,000 animal teams – 40% of farms are equipped in Chad, 25% in Cameroon and 10% in the Central African Republic. Two-oxen systems prevail. In production systems, animal power is primarily used for ploughing and secondarily for maintenance and transport. Animal draft has major agronomic (mechanization, agriculturelivestock integration) and socioeconomic functions. The equipment phase is a strategic time for the farmer. Since 1950, cotton companies have proposed equipment credits and technical aid that highly contributed to animal draft development. Farmers invested a large part of cotton revenues into this technique.', 'inCitations': ['e1cab86118df5ec8433fd30f8c4a3b98fa2cedff', 'a6732e18e06ab95b6a1fccd3a443a471dfce1cbf', 'a5211fccffd589074f507d17fa555caac934fcd5', 'b4c41d0046515f7eeac0bac75eff85b8d710f285', 'da99cf26996ba91814f13aeb8ab13e9c54f20259', 'bc42c6d476984a129d5c92101904fbd9ef798368', '8b92743f320ec34a2972eb64905f6ebf63d119de', '2da2b9e479c1c0a6f80355af60b48a26e6fa8c21', '9e294b61b2600e3c637e163e76e76519dd009951'], 'pdfUrls': ['http://agritrop.cirad.fr/514859/1/ID514859.pdf'], 'title': 'La traction animale dans le nouveau contexte des savanes cotonnières du Tchad, du Cameroun et de la République centrafricaine.

Des aimants sont places entre les vitres dans le cylindre creux a roulements libres et dans les glissieres inferieures, avec les fils correspondants formant une echelle qui retient les lamelles ou bandes individuelles du store venitien. Apres installation de la partie interne du store venitien, l'espace situe entre les vitres est en permanence isole de l'environnement. Une telle vitre isolante s'installe dans une fenetre ou une porte. Les seuls elements necessaires a l'utilisation et au reglage du store venitien sont les glissieres externes inferieures et superieures qui permettent de tourner a 180 degres le store venitien autour de l'axe longitudinal; de le lever ou de l'abaisser a l'aide de la latte externe inferieure ou superieure; ou encore de le deplacer en diagonale. Le store de l'invention comprend des fils formant echelle (11), qui retiennent les lamelles (12) disposees horizontalement a la distance appropriee. Cette structure est maintenue en supension par le cylindre creux a roulements libres (4) et reliee par sa partie inferieure a la section interne inferieure (7). Chaque aimant (8b) place dans les roulements (8) ou les aimants de contact internes superieurs/inferieurs (8a, 18a) sont equipes pour s'installer dans le pole magnetique oppose par rapport aux poles des aimants de contact externes superieurs/inferieurs (18, 18b) disposes sur la latte de reglage externe superieure ou inferieure (5, 6). Les aimants qui glissent horizontalement le long de la latte de reglage externe superieure (5) exercent une attraction sur les aimants places aux bords du cylindre creux a roulements libres (4). Le dispositif de reglage de la rotation (23a, 23b) commande la rotation a 180 degres des lamelles (12). Le deplacement simultane de latte de reglage externe inferieure ou superieure (6, 5) et des aimants qui leur sont associes assure le relevage ou l'abaissement du store venitien, et notamment le deplacement d'un seul cote de la latte de reglage externe superieure ou inferieure (5, 6). Ainsi, l'interaction desdits elements de l'invention permet d'occulter la lumiere sur une partie quelconque de la fenetre, notamment en diagonale le long de la fenetre.

This property has been used in this work to develop a simple sensor technology for online, real-time continuous monitoring of trace ozone in water. A Teflon AF2400 tube filled with pure water forms a liquid core waveguide (LCW), which is used as a long-path-length optical absorption cell. This pure water filled tube was deployed into a water sample. Ozone molecules dissolved in the water sample permeate through the Teflon AF2400 tube wall and dissolve in water filled in the tube. This prevents interference species from entering the LCW, and eliminates interferences. The optical absorption signal of the long-path-length cell at 254 nm measured by guiding light through the LCW is used as a sensing signal. This simple structured sensor does not involve any chemical reagent, is reversible, and has a response time <4.5 minutes.

Over the last decade, prescription omega-3 fatty acid products (RxOME3FAs) have been approved for medical indications. Nonetheless, there is no comprehensive analysis of safety and tolerability of RxOME3FAs so far.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out based on searches in six electronic databases. The studies involving marketed RxOME3FA products were included, and adverse-effect data were extracted for meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to explore the sources of potential heterogeneity.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAmong the 21 included RCTs (total 24,460 participants; 12,750 from RxOME3FA treatment cohort and 11,710 from control cohort), there was no definite evidence of any RxOME3FA-emerging serious adverse event. Compared with the control group, RxOME3FAs were associated with more treatment-related dysgeusia (fishy taste; p = 0.011) and skin abnormalities (eruption, itching, exanthema, or eczema; p < 0.001). Besides, RxOME3FAs had mild adverse effects upon some non-lipid laboratory measurements [elevated fasting blood sugar (p = 0.005); elevated alanine transaminase (p = 0.022); elevated blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.047); decreased hemoglobin (p = 0.002); decreased hematocrit (p = 0.009)]. Subgroup analysis revealed that EPA/DHA combination products were associated with more treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events [eructation (belching; p = 0.010); nausea (p = 0.044)] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol elevation (p = 0.009; difference in means = 4.106mg/dL).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nRxOME3FAs are generally safe and well tolerated but not free of adverse effects. Post-marketing surveillance and observational studies are still necessary to identify long-term adverse effects and to confirm the safety and tolerability profiles of RxOME3FAs.', 'inCitations': ['132c6137cc52a9440e972d6f803960b4624bd883', '1890cfb984266f85d54b1724750193a3a503da5a', 'aad98830e694efb67457664f65ad182039fb3a4d', '46f860e69b542a51fdbdfda04d2d5bedc08edd7b', 'eaa96eb402f533469c2c08a4dcfd652231780d70', '9ad27c90752a301417ef461b2edabe0ff8be26fa', '02ec6c003061cf8557f5a89442a127e2256f1f4f', 'e50c0bf34e32a9f20364cdd1923db05e402721ef', '1116a06cba9e84614fdf1508d254048b55ebdec4'], 'pdfUrls': ['https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/84331676/Safety_and_tolerability_of_CHANG_Publishedonline5January2018_GREEN_AAM_CC_BY_NC_ND_.pdf'], 'title': 'Safety and tolerability of prescription omega-3 fatty acids: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'doi': '10.1016/j.plefa.2018.01.001', 'sources': ['Medline'], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plefa.2018.01.001', 'venue': 'Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids'}\n",

We exploit the excluded volume effect on the clustering behaviors of various glass-formers and the temperature dependence (at fixed pressure of 1 atmosphere) of the entropy difference Δso between the two cluster states on the basis of zR=1+zRo[exp(−Δso/kB)−1], where zRo=1.8 as taken universally for all the glass-formers investigated. The temperature dependence of the average size 〈zc∗〉 of clusters with z≥zR is then determined for some representative glass-formers, such as GeO2, 1-propanol, glycerol, propylene carbonate, o-terphenyl, and so forth, covering the entire fragility spectrum studied experimentally. As a result, the temperature dependence of 〈zc∗〉 is found to highly depend on the fragility index ϑ associated with the temperature dependence of the excluded volume B∗(ϕ,T) of which statistical mechanical representation is given by the generic van der Waals equation of state. With decreasing T toward the glass transition temperature Tg, 〈zc∗〉 increases to attain universally about 13 at Tg regardless of the fragility and molecular details of the glass-formers. We specifically analyze in depth the theoretical predictions for the cluster sizes and the experimental estimations for the length scales associated with temporary clusters of slow segments in supercooled glycerol as about 1.4±0.5 nm for glycerol at 10 K above Tg.

The Ala-30----Arg, Ala-30----His and Ala-30----Phe substitutions drastically reduced the binding affinity, suggesting that the side chain in position 30 of Ala-30 of hEGF is required to be small for the receptor binding. The Asn-32----Asp substitution significantly reduced the binding affinity, while the Asn-32----His variant could bind to the receptor as well as to the wild-type hEGF. Therefore, it seems to be important for receptor binding that the side chain in position 32 does not have a negative charge but does have an NH group.

However, relations between Turk and Jew over the future of the Yishuv, the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine had far preceded this historical event. Indeed, in the early 1880s, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Abdul Hamid, had identified the potential benefit of a Jewish revival in Palestine, chiefly as a prospective source of income for the economically troubledOttomans.However, Abdul Hamid, unwilling to allow another diverse national group access to lands in his empire, aware that the Jews, were he to permit their immigration into Palestine, would be in propinquity to Jerusalem, Islam’s third holiest site, cautious not to exacerbate existing tensions with the Armenian population, and conscious of the possible effect on the various separatist movements in the Balkans and East Anatolia, prohibited Jewish immigration. This prohibition, although symbolically damaging to Jewish national aspirations, was inefficiently enforced due to both Zionist determination to create a national homeland and a lacklustre approach by the Ottomans and, in 1900 the Jewish population of the Yishuv had doubled to some 50,000, the preponderance of whom were new immigrants. Ultimately, it was Theodore Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, who, in June 1896, succeeded in convincing the sultan to give his implied consent to the Zionist enterprise in Palestine. Herzl arrived in Istanbul and although not granted an audience with the Sultan, was nevertheless asked on his behalf to aid in promulgating the Ottoman cause overseas, a cause gravely tarnished in the aftermath of the Armenian bloodshed and to organize a substantial loan of some T£2,000,000 for the financially strapped Ottomans. Subsequently, in a meeting with the sultan five years later, on 19May 1901, Herzl presented a tailored financial plan that would direct control of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration away from the European elites, and into the hands of the sultan. The plan would essentially involve the purchase of Ottoman debt by Jewish syndicates throughout the world over the course of a number of years. This would be done, Herzl stated, on a quid pro quo basis, in return for an Imperial Charter for the colonization of Palestine.', 'inCitations': [], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'The Genesis of Turkish Views on Partition and Conciliation', 'doi': '10.1080/13537120802127788', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1080/13537120802127788', 'venue': ''}\n",

Antiangiogenic agents have been found to be effective in treating several gynecologic diseases, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids.

In the modern era, slave migrations were a primary force in European mercantilism as tens of millions of people were captured, sold, and shipped from Africa to the Americas (Cohen 1995). Due to the vast profits in the slave trade that accrued to financial and commercial interests, it was essential to European mercantile capitalism (John 2006). The abolition of slavery by Britain in 1833, France and Denmark in 1848, and Holland in 1863 created new demands for cheap labor to support commerce and trade (Vertovec 1995), and the emancipation of African slaves in 1838 created a severe shortage of laborers working in sugar, coffee, tea, cocoa, rice, and rubber plantations (John 2006). Therefore, mercantile interests gradually replaced slavery with servitude and unfree labor. The terms “bonded labor,” “indentured servitude,” “peonage,” and “serfdom” are used synonymously but are different forms of servitude. \\n \\n \\nKeywords: \\n \\ncapitalism; \\ncolonialism; \\nempire; \\ngeopolitics; \\nlabor supply; \\npolitical economy; \\ntransnationalism; \\nracism', 'inCitations': [], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'Bonded labor and migration, India', 'doi': '10.1002/9781444351071.wbeghm068', 'sources': [], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444351071.wbeghm068', 'venue': ''}\n",

Participants included 331 youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5 years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions, including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand the emergence of internalizing symptomology.', 'inCitations': ['0b89790085c48990730674b63b3ba499d11eb6e3', '1294cde3d3d1293544c74805401efce02ebc62ab', 'b22f6ecd338ee39e0789488d0ac52f07b9fa0bd0', 'cc5cb883a72eea1333c7594be233eafb386c548e'], 'pdfUrls': [], 'title': 'The developmental trajectory of perceived stress mediates the relations between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms among youth.', 'doi': '10.1017/S0954579417000335', 'sources': ['Medline'], 'doiUrl': 'https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579417000335', 'venue': 'Development and psychopathology'}\n"

       "\"Existing traveler information systems provide mass information to a large group of users who plan to travel in a similar way. Such information, although provided at a real time basis, may not satisfy the real need of personal travel as the information is provided without much consideration on individual's preferences. The provision of personalized travel information through the development of a three-tier client server based traveler information system on Internet (TISONI) is discussed in the paper. In this system, personalized travel advices are provided through a combinatorial modeling approach, which combines models describing travel behavior and shortest path algorithm. TISONI is developed to provide personalized and multimodal transit travel information to users. The three-tier structure adopted in TISONI facilitates a convenient and efficient way to update and transmit data between client and server. The core of TISONI is a path choice model, which was developed by calibrating users' behavior in mode and route choices. The personalized information covers two main aspects: (1) recognition of the users and their preferences and (2) personalized information provided to users by learning. Based on the architecture presented, real time data transmission and process, user interfaces and connectivity were introduced integrating with path choice models. Java servlets, JSP, as new technologies, run on a TISONI server, features high performance, database connectivity, stability, and security and perform most dynamic content operations. An implementation and evaluation of TISONI prototype based on western part of Singapore was discussed. Such implementation aims to test and demonstrate the capability of dynamic modification, path search and decision models, computation speed, and users interface. The three main criteria including timeliness, intelligence and efficiency were used to evaluate the good performance of this prototype model. It is concluded that the proposed architecture is able to provide a stable and efficient platform for provision of personalized travel information to transit users.\""

       "'This paper considers the performance of a trunking system based on the MPT 1343 standard. Particular attention has been paid to the transmission of short data messages over the control channel in the presence of signalling required for the set-up of simple calls for speech and non-prescribed data transmission. In order to determine the performance, a simulation tool has been developed. This tool simulates a single-site trunking system with mobile radio units and connections to PSTN and PABX extension numbers. After a brief introduction to the protocol and standard user facilities, the simulation model and implementation of access scenarios are described. The most relevant simulation results are presented and discussed. Minor differences between MPT 1327 and MPT 1343 are beyond the scope of this paper and are not considered here.'"

Yet this is my view, and certainly comforting to me, also somewhat preoccupied with self-criticism as a writer and editor. Perhaps others will be similarly encouraged. By his John\\'s Hopkins years Osler \"had learned to conceal the effort which all good writing requires, even in the gifted.\" 1 Early Osier In 1875, when he was 26 years old, Osler delivered an address on behalf of the medical faculty to the graduating class at McGill University. The speech was not only one of his earliest but also one of his poorest efforts. The major problem is the lack of a coherent theme. Though it is short, the address switches from the importance of continued study, to', 'The study was aimed at the evaluation of changes in phenytoin pharmacokinetics during dietary induced hyperlipidemia in rabbits. It was carried out in 17 New Zealand, male rabbits, 3-month old, randomly assigned to two groups: control maintained on standard diet and experimental one fed on a high-fat diet for 2 months. Pharmacokinetic assays were performed in all animals after 2 months of the experiment. Phenytoin was given intragastrically as a single dose 10 mg/kg. Blood for assays was sampled within 48 hours after phenytoin administration. The two compartment open model for extravascular administration was used for calculations. It was demonstrated that the administration of phenytoin in the group of animals with experimental hyperlipidemia was followed by a decrease of the drug concentration in the blood serum, a drop in area under the plasma concentration-time curve, a shorter elimination half-time as well as an increase in total body clearance. All revealed changes suggest that the dietary induced hyperlipidemic state alters the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, leading to a faster drug elimination from the body.'] as keyword args.

Such information, although provided at a real time basis, may not satisfy the real need of personal travel as the information is provided without much consideration on individual's preferences. The provision of personalized travel information through the development of a three-tier client server based traveler information system on Internet (TISONI) is discussed in the paper.

The three-tier structure adopted in TISONI facilitates a convenient and efficient way to update and transmit data between client and server. The core of TISONI is a path choice model, which was developed by calibrating users' behavior in mode and route choices. The personalized information covers two main aspects: (1) recognition of the users and their preferences and (2) personalized information provided to users by learning. Based on the architecture presented, real time data transmission and process, user interfaces and connectivity were introduced integrating with path choice models.

In this system, personalized travel advices are provided through a combinatorial modeling approach, which combines models describing travel behavior and shortest path algorithm. TISONI is developed to provide personalized and multimodal transit travel information to users. The three-tier structure adopted in TISONI facilitates a convenient and efficient way to update and transmit data between client and server. The core of TISONI is a path choice model, which was developed by calibrating users' behavior in mode and route choices. The personalized information covers two main aspects: (1) recognition of the users and their preferences and (2) personalized information provided to users by learning. Based on the architecture presented, real time data transmission and process, user interfaces and connectivity were introduced integrating with path choice models. Java servlets, JSP, as new technologies, run on a TISONI server, features high performance, database connectivity, stability, and security and perform most dynamic content operations. An implementation and evaluation of TISONI prototype based on western part of Singapore was discussed. Such implementation aims to test and demonstrate the capability of dynamic modification, path search and decision models, computation speed, and users interface. The three main criteria including timeliness, intelligence and efficiency were used to evaluate the good performance of this prototype model.

       "\"Existing traveler information systems provide mass information to a large group of users who plan to travel in a similar way. Such information, although provided at a real time basis, may not satisfy the real need of personal travel as the information is provided without much consideration on individual's preferences. The provision of personalized travel information through the development of a three-tier client server based traveler information system on Internet (TISONI) is discussed in the paper. In this system, personalized travel advices are provided through a combinatorial modeling approach, which combines models describing travel behavior and shortest path algorithm. TISONI is developed to provide personalized and multimodal transit travel information to users. The three-tier structure adopted in TISONI facilitates a convenient and efficient way to update and transmit data between client and server. The core of TISONI is a path choice model, which was developed by calibrating users' behavior in mode and route choices. The personalized information covers two main aspects: (1) recognition of the users and their preferences and (2) personalized information provided to users by learning. Based on the architecture presented, real time data transmission and process, user interfaces and connectivity were introduced integrating with path choice models. Java servlets, JSP, as new technologies, run on a TISONI server, features high performance, database connectivity, stability, and security and perform most dynamic content operations. An implementation and evaluation of TISONI prototype based on western part of Singapore was discussed. Such implementation aims to test and demonstrate the capability of dynamic modification, path search and decision models, computation speed, and users interface. The three main criteria including timeliness, intelligence and efficiency were used to evaluate the good performance of this prototype model. It is concluded that the proposed architecture is able to provide a stable and efficient platform for provision of personalized travel information to transit users.\""

       "'This paper considers the performance of a trunking system based on the MPT 1343 standard. Particular attention has been paid to the transmission of short data messages over the control channel in the presence of signalling required for the set-up of simple calls for speech and non-prescribed data transmission. In order to determine the performance, a simulation tool has been developed. This tool simulates a single-site trunking system with mobile radio units and connections to PSTN and PABX extension numbers. After a brief introduction to the protocol and standard user facilities, the simulation model and implementation of access scenarios are described. The most relevant simulation results are presented and discussed. Minor differences between MPT 1327 and MPT 1343 are beyond the scope of this paper and are not considered here.'"
